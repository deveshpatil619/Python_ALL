#Arithmetic operators

x=2
y=3
print(x+y)

print(x**y) #Exponentiation means to the power

print(x%y) #It gives the quotient in division

print((x/y))  # It gives us the remainder inthe division

print(x//y)  ##the floor division // rounds the result down to the nearest whole number

#Python Assignment Operators

x-=y
print(x)

x*=y
print(x)

x**=y
print(y)

## Relational operators

a=1
b=2

print(a==b)
print(a!=b)
print(a>=b)

##Python Logical Operators

print(a > 3 and b < 10) # in and both the conditions must be true
print(a > 3 or b < 10) # in the or condition even if one condition is true it returns true
c= not(a > 3 and b < 10) # not will reverse the result i.e if its true it will return false and if its false it will return true
print(c)

## Bitwise operator
